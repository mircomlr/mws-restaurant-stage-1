# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

## UDACITY FEND-Course / Project 6 

For this **Restaurant Reviews** projects, i had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

### Specification

I have been provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less on a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t worked offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What can you do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the experience now looks like (-:
 (Sorry, but a full functional mapbox-api-key is missing. You can replace the given one with the 3 small x at the end in two files with your api-key.)

3. I worked on three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

4. And i wrote code to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
